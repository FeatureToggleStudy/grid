# DEV Setup

## Requirements
Project requirements are listed in a [Brewfile](../Brewfile).

## AWS Credentials
The Grid requires AWS credentials when running locally to access the resources created by the
[dev CloudFormation stack](./01-cloudformation.md). The credentials should be stored under a
[profile](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-multiple-profiles.html) named
`media-service`.

Developers working at the Guardian can get these credentials from Janus.

## Setup
Once your CloudFormation stack has been created, run:

```bash
./scripts/setup.sh
```

### NGINX, Play & SNI
As the Play Framework does not yet support [SNI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Server_Name_Indication)
 NGINX can't always work out which certificate to send where when there are multiple services on the same IP.
 This might result in NGINX sending the incorrect certificate resulting in a `HostnameVerifier Exception`.

#### Resolution

When the correct cert to send is ambiguous, NGINX simply sends the first cert it sees in it's configuration,
which is loaded from config files in alphabetical order.

To resolve this problem, prefix your grid config filename with `0-`.
